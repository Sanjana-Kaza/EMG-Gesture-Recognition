Hand gesture recognition system based on an electromyography signal is proposed for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) hand letters. Eight sign language letters in the ASL library are selected for recognition. Raw EMG signal was collected using a multi-channel EMG sensor, Oymotion gforcePro.
An accuracy of 98% for Random Forest Classifier was observed.
